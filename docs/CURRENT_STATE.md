# CURRENT_STATE

Factual snapshot. **Rewrite this file after each milestone** — do not append history.

_Last updated: 2026-08-06 (M13E2 Phase C closeout — code complete locally, nothing pushed)_

## M13E2 — server-bound practice sessions: code complete locally, unpushed

**M13E2 code is locally complete.** Phase A (schema) is pushed and deployed. Phase B (`npm run
db:push` against the shared Production database) is complete, so the practice-session enums, tables,
foreign keys, indexes and unique constraints are **active in the database**. Phases C1, C2a, C2b,
C3a and C3b are **committed locally and none of them has been pushed or deployed**.

**The application is no longer deliberately mid-cutover locally.** Debate drills, DECA drills, HOSA
Medical Terminology, guided lesson practice and Debate Writing now use the **same** server-issued
session protocol end to end — routes and clients speak one contract. That is true **locally only**.

### What the protocol guarantees, in local code

- **The server issues the work.** Session start picks the questions or the writing scenario
  server-side, shuffles each question's choices, mints an opaque `crypto.randomUUID()` id per served
  choice, stores the answer key, and freezes everything into a versioned, kind-discriminated
  `scenarioJson` snapshot.
- **Unanswered answer keys are not required by the converted clients.** An unanswered item ships its
  prompt and its shuffled choices and nothing else — no correct answer, no correct option id, no
  explanation. The clients render feedback only from what the server returns after it has recorded
  an answer, and from already-answered items on resume.
- **Grading uses the persisted session snapshot**, never a live bank lookup, so a question edited
  after issuance cannot change a grade already earned.
- **The first accepted answer to a distinct item is final.** A later different pick returns the
  stored first answer rather than replacing it.
- **Repeated padded visual slots share one distinct-item answer state.** A focused twenty-question
  session stores nine distinct item rows plus a persisted twenty-slot order of repeated item ids;
  the repeats add no extra evidence, mastery, review or XP.
- **Final drill submissions send only `{ sessionId }`.** Writing submission sends only
  `{ sessionId, response }`.
- **A completed retry replays the stored result before any effect runs** — before the grader, before
  review and mastery, and before XP.
- **HOSA remains review-only** and no drill route awards XP.
- **Writing, test-grade and judge XP/rank writes use the concurrency-safe transactional helper**
  (`awardXpInTransaction`): an atomic increment whose rank derives from the value the increment
  returned. The previous read-add-write could be erased by a concurrent writer, because a plain
  SELECT never blocks under MVCC.

### What each phase contains

| Phase | Commit | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| C1 | `59dd52b` | `lib/practice-session.ts` (new), transaction-native review/mastery cores appended to `lib/spaced-review.ts`, `awardXpInTransaction` in `lib/xp.ts`, additive schemas in `lib/validators.ts`, `scripts/practice-session-smoke.ts` (new) |
| C2a | `dd11e69` | The nine Debate / DECA / HOSA MedTerm drill routes — session, check and submit — bound to server-issued sessions |
| C2b | `4f0c856` | `app/api/skills/debate-writing/session/route.ts` (new) plus the writing submit cutover, and the XP/rank cutover for `tests/[testId]/grade` and `debates/[debateId]/judge` |
| C3a-i | `80dbf75` | Debate drills client |
| C3a-ii | `be97024` | DECA drills client and HOSA MedTerm client, plus an explicit `checkEndpoint` prop on the shared concept-drills component |
| C3b-i | `9103693` | Guided lesson practice client — the last legacy caller of the old drill contract |
| C3b-ii | `f392ede` | Debate Writing client |

Preserved exactly across all of it: Debate and DECA evidence floors of 5, HOSA's 10-unique-across-3-
areas, the threshold of 70 (exact-ratio for HOSA), the honest 6-of-9 result of 67, no XP on any drill
track, and the public M13E1G helpers with their seven review variants, their returned `write-failed`,
their missing-table degradation and assertion 28c.

### What is deliberately unchanged

- **`enforceRateLimit` is absent from both Debate Writing routes.** That surface has never had rate
  limiting, redesign is deferred, and three suites assert the absence. Do not "fix" it.
- **The drill check routes are deliberately not rate-limited.** The light tier is 20/min and a
  twenty-question drill needs 22 calls.
- **`wins` and `streak` in the judge route are untouched.** They still read-modify-write from a
  pre-read; that staleness is carried work, and `practice-session:smoke` controls 144–144c pin the
  existing behaviour so it cannot drift while it waits.
- **`app/(app)/skills/[slug]/practice/page.tsx` still passes `initialScenario`** to the writing
  client. The prop is accepted for compatibility and is **never read** — it is not destructured in
  the component — and the scenario a learner is graded against is the one the server issues. Its
  caller was outside the approved Phase C boundary, so removing it is separate follow-up work.

### What has NOT happened

- **No Phase C schema change and no Phase C database operation.** No `db push`, no migration, no
  seed, no reset, no activation, no learner-data read or write.
- **No Redis and no new secret** were introduced or are required.
- **Nothing in Phase C is pushed or deployed.** **Production still runs
  `221e07f744b92b5ed3e68a8fcb56e21b3bd2fd37`** — the pre-C1 commit, and therefore still the old
  routes, which still return answer keys and accept unbound submissions.
- **Authenticated Production behavior of the session protocol is not claimed.** Nothing behind
  sign-in has been exercised in Production for any of this work.
- **The three database-writing suites — `auth:smoke`, `team:smoke`, `assignment:smoke` — were not
  run** and must not be claimed as passing.

Remaining steps: a GitHub Desktop push, the automatic Vercel Production deployment that follows, and
a read-only deployment verification.

## Repository state

- **Branch:** `main`
- **origin/main and remote `refs/heads/main`:** `221e07f` (the M13E2 Phase A commit)
- **Local `HEAD`:** the M13E2 Phase C closeout commit, **eight commits ahead of `origin/main`, zero
  behind** — a normal fast-forward with no merge commits.
- The eight local commits are the seven Phase C code commits in the table above plus this
  documentation closeout. Nothing has been pushed or deployed by the agent.
- **Working tree:** clean apart from this pass's own edits to the two documentation files.
- Cumulative Phase C change against `221e07f`: **34 paths — 6 added, 28 modified, none deleted or
  renamed** (including these two documents). No schema change, no migration, no seed change, no
  dependency, no lockfile change, no env or deployment-config change. `package.json` changed only to
  register `practice-session:smoke`.
- Sections below the milestone table describe the M11 close-out and were last re-verified on
  2026-08-01 against `d7efcb5`.
- The nine approved M11 commits (eight code, one documentation) were **pushed through a normal
  fast-forward**. No force-push, rebase, squash, merge or history rewrite occurred at any point.

## Milestone status

| Milestone | Status |
|---|---|
| M1–M10 | Complete |
| M11 — independent review + documentation | Complete. Its verdict was NOT READY; every finding it raised has since been remediated. |
| M11R1–M11R12 — remediation passes | Complete. **No confirmed M11 code finding remains open.** |
| M13E1D–M13E1F — drill evidence safety (DECA, Debate, HOSA) | Complete, pushed and deployed. |
| M13E1G — due-gated spaced review | Complete, pushed and deployed (`95fdd4c`). |
| M13E2 Phase A — additive practice-session schema | Complete, pushed and deployed (`221e07f`). |
| M13E2 Phase B — shared-Production `db push` | **Complete.** Enums, tables, foreign keys and indexes are active. |
| M13E2 Phase C1 — server-session core helpers | **Complete locally** (`59dd52b`). Unpushed. |
| M13E2 Phase C2a — Debate, DECA and HOSA routes | **Complete locally** (`dd11e69`), session-backed. Unpushed. |
| M13E2 Phase C2b — Debate Writing routes and XP/rank safety | **Complete locally** (`4f0c856`). Unpushed. |
| M13E2 Phase C3a — Debate, DECA and HOSA clients | **Complete locally** (`80dbf75`, `be97024`). Unpushed. |
| M13E2 Phase C3b — lesson practice and Debate Writing clients | **Complete locally** (`9103693`, `f392ede`). Unpushed. |
| M13E2 — overall | **Code complete locally.** Awaiting push, automatic deployment and read-only deployment verification. |
| M4 — HOSA replacement scenario | **Still blocked.** Needs an approved scenario and the applicable clinical/legal or advisor review. Until then the lesson's interactive practice stays unavailable. |

## Shipped behavior (as implemented locally)

**Debate.** Claim/Warrant/Impact is presented as one officially supported beginner model, not the only
one. Practice routes to `/debate` with an AI opponent and judge. No universal 0–30 speaker-point scale
is claimed anywhere.

**DECA.** The authored role-play lesson requires both learner responses past a shared eight-word gate.
Coach feedback must be rubric-complete **and** evidence-anchored — a two-entry `responseReview` plus one
verdict per authored criterion, each `met`/`partial` excerpt actually appearing in the response it names.
Anything else is discarded and an honest retry is shown. Timing is family-specific: the 10-minute prep
example is labelled Individual Series, Team Decision Making carries its own sourced 30/15, and PBA, PFL
and PSC carry none because our record has none. TDM exam weighting remains unresolved and absent. An
"Exam weighting" section renders only for a family whose own sourced facts establish an exam — today
Individual Series and TDM. DECA role-play practice remains active.

**HOSA.** The generic patient/clinical role-play is **withdrawn**. `/training/hosa/practice` is Medical
Terminology-specific; `/training/hosa/room` fails closed to the Event Navigator before any room mounts;
`/compete` offers event navigation rather than a role-play arena; `/api/ai/hosa-scenario` and
`/api/ai/judge-hosa` return a stable HTTP 410 behind their unchanged auth-then-rate-limit gates,
reaching no provider, parsing no body, producing no score and writing nothing. Medical Terminology
practice, its registry provenance and its session/submit recording are unchanged and remain reachable
from its Event HQ. The communication lesson is informational and communication-only; its interactive
scenario is `temporarily-unavailable`; it neither teaches nor scores hands-on procedures; and the
absence of a standalone patient-communication event is stated as a finding about the approved research
record, never as a permanent fact.

**Both browsing surfaces.** The DECA and HOSA Navigators name their groupings as **CompeteReady
training groups** directly above the group lists, and state that the learner's current official event
guideline controls official classification and requirements. Family resolution is registry-derived and
fails closed: one routable member resolves to that named event; zero or several resolve to an
href-free non-interactive state whose recovery link is the HOSA hub — never the page it is rendered on.

**Track isolation and navigation.** Each Navigator resolves only its own parameter through its own
registry; cross-track identifiers resolve to nothing in both directions; `/training/debate/events`
fails closed; the Debate hub's start action still routes to `/debate` (there is no UI element literally
labeled "Start Debate" — the routing, not a label, is what is pinned); stable lesson slugs and Event HQ
links intact.

**Side Coach.** Two maximum-length 4,000-character learner responses are accepted; the field bound
counts the learner allowance and the bounded framing separately and remains hard-capped. Rubric IDs are
canonicalised against the authored lesson's own rubric — anything but the exact set fails closed at the
route with a stable `invalid-rubric-ids`, before any provider call, echoing nothing back. Validation
failure is distinct from provider unavailability.

**Authored progress.** The follow-up is earned by an explicit Continue click, gated by the shared
eight-word rule. Restore honours the persisted decision and validates it against phase and gate;
meaningful text alone never recreates an unlock. The gate counts word-like tokens — a token containing
a Unicode letter or number — so punctuation-only and emoji-only input cannot satisfy it, on the live
button and on restore alike.

**Accessibility.** Navigator result buttons contain no paragraph descendants, carry the project
`focus-ring` utility, and keep a coherent `h1 → h2 → h3` outline in every rendered state. Selected
styling and the keyboard focus ring render together. The converted practice clients keep their
distinct loading, expired, unavailable and retryable-error states, so status is never carried by
colour alone.

## Test results (2026-08-06, against the Phase C stack plus these documentation edits)

- `npm run db:generate` — passes.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — passes.
- `npm run lint` — **0 errors** (one pre-existing warning: `<img>` in `components/profile/user-avatar.tsx`).
- `npm run build` — compiles successfully. The build was never run alongside a dev server.
- **32 registered `*:smoke` suites. 29 safe/read-only suites were run and all 29 pass.**
- **`auth:smoke`, `team:smoke` and `assignment:smoke` write to the shared Production database. They
  were NOT run in this pass and are NOT claimed to pass.**
- `judge-shape:smoke` makes a live provider call and exits 0 with a console warning when no provider
  responds — it was run on its own and its output read, not through a stdout-discarding loop.
- Focused harnesses from earlier milestones (M8A, M8B, M9 SSR; M10 navigation/accessibility; M11R2
  through M11R12) live in the session scratchpad, not in the repository.

## Browser and mobile validation

Verified by serving each surface's emitted SSR markup with the app's own compiled CSS over a local HTTP
server, because the browser-preview helper cannot launch from `~/Documents`. Checked at 375×812,
390×844 and 1280×900: no horizontal overflow, 44px recovery targets on the HOSA hub, coherent heading
order, and — with **real keyboard Tab** — `:focus-visible` matching plus a non-zero project focus ring on
navigator result buttons, including a selected button and in colorblind mode.

**This is not the live authenticated route.** No middleware, session, data fetching or click-through of
real navigation was exercised. No screen-reader certification and no full keyboard journey was performed.
**The converted practice flow has not been exercised against a live authenticated session** in any
environment — its guarantees are established by code and by deterministic suites, not by a learner run.

## Known gates and unresolved items

1. **The Phase C stack is unpushed.** Production runs the pre-C1 commit and therefore still serves the
   old, unbound practice routes. Nothing about M13E2 may be described as live.
2. **Authenticated verification of the session protocol is outstanding** — no learner run, in any
   environment, has exercised issue → check → submit end to end.
3. **M4 HOSA replacement scenario** — blocked pending an approved scenario and clinical/legal or advisor
   review. If none is approved, the interactive practice stays unavailable.
4. **September 1, 2026 HOSA revalidation** — the final 2026-27 guidelines are expected then; every
   officially dependent HOSA detail must be re-checked against that release and later notices. Nothing
   in the code degrades a record automatically when that date passes.
5. **TDM weighting** — DECA's Guide and its published sample conflict; no figure may be stated until
   DECA resolves it.
6. **PSC scope** — the record places Professional Selling both inside and outside the role-play course;
   unresolved by design, and it routes to the DECA hub rather than the role-play lesson.
7. **`docs/curriculum/` provenance** — provenance comments in the registries cite line numbers into the
   approved research record; keep that record and the citations in step.
8. **Advisor/judge validation gates** from the research synthesis remain open; evidence validation
   proves an excerpt is real, not that a verdict is correct.
9. **`initialScenario`** is still accepted by the writing client and still passed by its page, purely
   for compatibility. It is never read. Removing it is separate follow-up work.
10. **XP-farming policy for writing** is deferred, not silently changed: one issued session awards XP at
    most once, but requesting a new session and completing it still awards the current amount.

## Remote and deployment status

`origin/main` and the remote `refs/heads/main` are both
`221e07f744b92b5ed3e68a8fcb56e21b3bd2fd37` — the M13E2 Phase A commit — and **that is what Production
runs.** M13E1G (`95fdd4c`) and Phase A (`221e07f`) were each pushed and their Production deployments
verified in their own passes. Nothing after `221e07f` has been pushed or deployed.

The most recent full commit-linked deployment record on file is for
`d7efcb59ed94ca887f9d562ef21ea4723dde1175`, verified from unauthenticated GitHub metadata:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | Vercel |
| GitHub deployment ID | `5700303276` |
| Commit status ID | `51469218987` |
| Environment | `Production` |
| State | `success` ("Deployment has completed") |
| Deployment-specific URL | `https://debate-arena-k697ureau-habibisters-projects.vercel.app` |
| Production alias | `https://debate-arena-ai.vercel.app` |

The deployment-specific URL is behind **Vercel Deployment Protection** and redirects to Vercel SSO, so
it exposes no application behaviour without provider authentication. The production alias serves
CompeteReady (`<title>CompeteReady</title>`), and `/` returns **200**.

**Public route checks.** All nine critical routes — `/training/hosa`, `/training/hosa/events`,
`/training/hosa/practice`, `/training/hosa/room`,
`/training/hosa/event/medical-terminology`, `/training/deca/events`, `/lessons`, `/compete`, `/debate`
— returned an intentional application **307** to `/signin?callbackUrl=…`, followed by **200** on the
sign-in page. One redirect each; no loops, no error boundaries.

**API authentication boundary.** Unauthenticated `POST /api/ai/hosa-scenario` and
`POST /api/ai/judge-hosa` both returned **401** with
`{"error":"You must be signed in to do that."}` — authentication remains first.

**What this does and does not establish.** It establishes that the Production deployment for that
commit succeeded, that those routes exist and are auth-gated, and that the two HOSA-only AI endpoints
authenticate before anything else. It does **not** establish any protected page's internal behaviour:
no authenticated session was used, so nothing behind sign-in was exercised in production. A public
alias cannot by itself prove which commit it currently serves; commit-linked deployment metadata is
the evidence.

**Remote incident.** On 2026-07-31 at 16:22:41 local, `origin/main` moved from `a6f0e78` to `700f40e`
— a push from this clone that was not part of any approved step. The source is **unknown and is not
attributed to anyone**. Treat the remote as capable of changing outside this workflow: re-verify it
immediately before any push.

## Environment variables (names only — never store values here)

`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_MODEL`, `GROQ_API_KEY`, `GROQ_MODEL`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`,
`OPENROUTER_MODEL`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_MODEL`, `AI_PROVIDER`, `AI_COST_MODE`,
`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`, `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`, `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`,
`NEXTAUTH_URL`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`, `APP_URL`, `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN`.

**M13E2 introduced no new environment variable and no new secret.** No Redis and no signing secret are
used or required by the session design — PostgreSQL is the only store.

## Next operational steps

1. Review the Phase C stack (`git log origin/main..HEAD`, `git diff origin/main..HEAD`).
2. Push the eight local commits through GitHub Desktop as a normal fast-forward. Re-verify
   `origin/main` immediately beforehand.
3. Let the automatic Vercel Production deployment run; verify it read-only from commit-linked public
   GitHub metadata.
4. Perform authenticated verification of the practice session flow when a safe session is available —
   issue, check, resume, duplicate-submit and completed-replay.
5. Remove the unused `initialScenario` prop from `app/(app)/skills/[slug]/practice/page.tsx` and the
   writing client's prop type.
6. Begin the visual redesign, then stabilize the design system.
7. Add interactive card games, mini-games, progression, XP and streak features.

## What is explicitly NOT true

- **M13E2 is not live.** Every Phase C guarantee above is **local only**. Production runs `221e07f`
  and still serves the old routes, which return answer keys and accept unbound submissions.
- **No authenticated production behaviour was verified** — not for the session protocol, and not for
  the earlier surfaces (HOSA hub wording, Medical-Terminology-specific practice, the HOSA room's
  post-auth fail-closed redirect, the post-auth HOSA `410` contract, the Compete HOSA entry, DECA
  training-group wording and family-specific timing, PSC's unresolved state, the lessons index,
  navigator focus rings, heading outlines, authored-progress restore, Side Coach structured feedback).
- **The three database-writing suites were not run**, and no result is claimed for them.
- The practice session design is **not** described as cheat-proof. It removes client answer authority,
  binds submissions to a server-issued set, makes first answers final and replays completed sessions
  without re-running effects. It is not a claim about every possible abuse.
- It is **not** claimed that the public alias cryptographically proves which SHA it serves.
- It is **not** claimed that every protected page is error-free; they could not be opened.
- The source of the earlier remote push is **not** known.
- Generic HOSA patient/clinical role-play is **not** available — it was withdrawn.
- It is **not** true that all HOSA practice is unavailable: Medical Terminology practice is active and
  records attempts, and it remains **review-only** — it awards no XP.
- CompeteReady's event groupings are **not** official DECA or HOSA taxonomy.
- No universal DECA preparation time or exam weighting is claimed.
- Curriculum guidance is **not** permanently current; the 2026-27 HOSA release requires revalidation.
- Nothing has been rebased, squashed or amended; **no Phase C schema change, migration, `db push` or
  seed was run**; no dependency or lockfile changed.
